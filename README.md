# Detection-and-Mitigation-of-DDoS-attack-in-SDN-using-Machine-Learning
Software Defined Networking is a networking paradigm. It has many advantages as compared to the traditional networks. It is scalable, flexible and solves many security issues. These networks are exposed to various security threats and attacks, like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To solve this problem, a model is proposed that is able to detect and mitigate attacks using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in Software Defined Networks. Six ML algorithms are evaluated in this project, like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree. The results showed that Random Forest is the best ML algorithm among all the selected algorithms to detect and mitigate the attack. Also, results show that the model is able to detect attacks and mitigate accurately.
